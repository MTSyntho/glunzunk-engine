| :-------- | :------------------------- |
| 🔽 Download GZ Engine to make Games |  Goto the itch.io page or Releases page to download it! |
| 💜 Contribute to the Engine ❤ | Install everything in requirements.txt and Python ~3.11 and don't mess up already existing code. |

> Please don't make the code very messy, it's probably already messy enough.

## ❓ How GZ Engine Compiles Games?
Your Glunzunk Project is by default, just a collection of JSON files and your game assets.

When building your game, it is first going to be rewritten into JavaScript code that modern browsers should understand and execute.

After building a web build of your game, using tools like Electron, NW.JS, Cordova, etc, you'll be able to export your game to any platform of your choice.

(If your game utilizes python code, it will not be eligible for a web build, unless i figure webaseembly (which is unlikely))

## 💻 How to Compile GZ Engine?
Install all modules in `requirements.txt`
And compile via `pyinstaller`
`pyinstaller` command-line arguments have yet to be determined, as the engine hasn't been compiled before.
