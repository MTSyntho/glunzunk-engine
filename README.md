## ❓ How GZ Engine Compiles Games?
Your Glunzunk Project is exported as a python project, which then using `pyinstaller`, the game can be compiled for Windows, Mac & Linux, and using Kivy's `buildozer`, Android builds are compiled.
Traditional methods of compilation done-through electron, nw.js or cordova is typically avoided due to the potential of games containing important python code required for it to function correctly.

## 💻 How to Compile GZ Engine?
Install all modules in `requirements.txt`
And compile via `pyinstaller`
`pyinstaller` command-line arguments have yet to be determined, as the engine hasn't been compiled before.
